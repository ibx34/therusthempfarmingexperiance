## About seeds && genetics
Okay, this is very simple. The base thing for growing ANY plant is a seed, right? Even humans need a seed. When a seed is picked it will be generated **SIX** random genes from the following list: Growth, Yield, Water, and Empty. Similarly to Rust's system, some of these genetics are negative. The Empty genetic is, well, empty. It's nothing! The Water genetic determines how much water your plant needs. The more W genetics on your plant, the more water it will take.  
  
It's your farm to decide what happens on but personally, I recommend a good seed with good growth and yield :) like rust :))))). Crossbreeding will come once the server structure is created. bye thats all for now.
